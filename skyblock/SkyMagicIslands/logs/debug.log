If any items are left behind in the grid during world upgrade they will be returned and not lost. No changes were made to the remotes or to other blocks). Fixed a null pointer exception "

		,"1.11.2":"Ported the Cable Facades feature (from Minecraft 1.12.2), so that you can shift-left-click with a block on a cable to hide it with a facade.  Disable this feature or ignore certain blocks with the config file"
		,"1.11.3":"Fixed item tooltips not rendering in Storage Remote.  Fixed visual rendering and text errors inside of import/export cables using the 'operation upgrade'"
		,"1.12.0":"Added a new Expanded Request Table and the Expanded Remote to support GUI Scale 2 or larger for players on large monitors/resolutions.  Internal refactoring for Import and Export cable capabilities: item transactions are now executed inside the cable tile-entities instead of the main node tile-entity (meaning the main root node is doing less processing work, and also the network overall should have fewer wasted cycles).  "
